#### Issues

In any project it's likely that a few bugs will slip through the cracks, so it
helps greatly if people document any bugs they find to ensure that they get
fixed promptly.

You can view a list of known issues, feature requests and submit new ones using [the issue tracker](
https://github.com/DNLDsht/LeafPic/issues).
Where appropriate, a screenshot works wonders to help us see exactly what the
issue is.
